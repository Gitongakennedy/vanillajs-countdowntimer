   <figure class="figure">Two Roads diverged in the yellow wood,And sorry I couldn't travel both and be one traveller,
    long I stood and looked down one as far as I could to where it bent in the undergrowth,then took the other just as fair,And having perhaps the better claim because it was grassy and wanted wear,Oh I kept the first one for another day,yet knowing how way leads to way,I doubted if I should ever comeback,two roads diverged in the wood and I- I took the one less travelled by and that has made all the difference. <figcaption>The Road Not taken By <cite>Robert Frost</cite></figcaption></figure>
